<p>As the role of the scientist has evolved throughout time, it has changed from being an advocate of the devil to a crucial part of humanity. However, in the past century, the scientist has become a fully integrated role in society. In <em>The Theory of Everything</em>, the viewer is show Stephen Hawking not only being praised for his work, but shown affection and respect for his battle with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) that eventually leaves him completely paralyzed. Similar to how the role of the scientist changed over time, the treatment of the differently abled has drastically changed for the better throughout the years. Dr. Hawking’s ALS began to develop in the 1960’s, and at this point in time, it was still extremely difficult for the differently abled to be treated as an equal in society. However, as <em>The Theory of Everything</em> showcases, Stephen Hawking was able to use his brilliance as a scientist, a role previously considered demonic and detrimental to society, to overcome the social hurdles of his disability and became one of the most well known physicists of all time. The film uses Stephen’s struggle with adversity to portray the role of the scientist in an extremely positive light. Three scenes in the film that showcase how Dr. Hawking uses his respect as a scientist to overcome the stigma of being differently abled are his presentation of his theory to his peers, getting his wheelchair that allowed him to speak, and Dr. Hawking’s response to the questioning of his faith at his book conference.</p>

<p>Early in the film, Stephen presents his theory of black holes to a classroom of scholars. While the reactions to his theory seem to split the room, the opposition never mentions Stephen’s disability, and keep the focus on the theory itself. This scene is the perfect example of how the filmmakers keep the focus on Dr. Hawking’s academic theory and never address his disability. This is the first scene in the movie where Stephen is shown as an excellent physicist who happens to have a disability and not the other way around.</p>

<p>Part of what allowed Dr. Hawking to deal with his ALS for so long was his iconic wheelchair that was equipped with text-to-speech tools allowing him to talk once he physically could not. Because of his popularity and success, Stephen Hawking had connections to tools and technology most people in his position did not. In <em>The Theory of Everything</em>, the viewer is shown how Dr. Hawking’s wife struggles to create a system to communicate with him, but once he has access to the talking wheelchair, he is once again able to talk, unlike anyone else with his condition at the time. The viewer can assume this is the only tool like it at the time because of how the inventor talks about how he had to build it from scratch using some pieces of a telephone set. The reason Dr. Hawking is able to get access to a custom wheelchair like this is directly tied to his fame that was a bi-product of his success as a physicist. This once again shows how Stephen Hawking’s role as a scientist allowed him to overcome his condition, whereas in the past when scientists were viewed negatively, this would never have been possible.</p>

<p>At the end of the film, Stephen Hawking is at a Q&amp;A Session where he is asked what he believes in since he is publicly known to not believe in God. Dr. Hawking responds by showing his belief in humanity when he says, “there should be no boundary to human endeavor, we are all different, however bad life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. While there is life, there is hope.”  Not only is this an inspirational way to end the film but it helps drive home the message of how Dr. Stephen Hawking was able to overcome simply being a mute a paralyzed ALS victim and instead has become one of the greatest physicists of all time.</p>
